# TestSprite: onboard a repo with a seed test suite

Your job is to take a repo that has **no TestSprite tests yet** and leave it with a
**coherent, runnable suite** plus a couple of **already-green** smoke tests — in one pass.
A new user who can immediately run a real, passing test is an activated user; an empty
project is the #1 drop-off.

This skill only uses shipped CLI commands. Do **not** call backend APIs directly.

Step 3 offers two paths to a suite, tried in order: let TestSprite **generate** the tests
(fastest; needs a V3-platform account and a recent CLI), or **author** them by hand
(always works). Everything else here is identical either way.

## When to use

- Right after `testsprite setup`, or any time the active project has 0–1 tests.
- The user says "set up tests", "bootstrap", "seed a suite", "get me started", or similar.

## When NOT to use

- The project already has tests — that's the `testsprite-verify` skill's job, not this one.
- The user only changed code and wants it checked — again, `testsprite-verify`.

## Prerequisites

`testsprite setup` has run (an API key is configured). If `testsprite project list` errors on
auth, stop and tell the user to run `testsprite setup` first — don't try to configure for them.

## Steps

### 1. Understand the app (don't skip — this is where coverage quality comes from)

Read the repo to establish, concretely:

- **Frontend**: the deployed/local **URL**, the 4–8 most important user flows (auth, core
  CRUD, checkout, search, settings…), and whether flows need **login**.
- **Backend**: the key **API endpoints** and their success/error contracts.

Prefer **code-derived** routes/handlers over guessing — you have the source; use it. This
beats a blind crawl.

### 2. Create the project (FE must have a URL)

Frontend:

```bash
testsprite project create --type frontend --name "<repo name>" --url <app-url> \
  [--username <user> --password-file <path-to-secret>]
```

Backend:

```bash
testsprite project create --type backend --name "<repo name>"
```

Capture the returned `projectId`.

> **Critical for FE**: a frontend test with no resolvable target URL fails immediately with
> `No environment URL configured` — the suite goes all-red. Always pass `--url`. If flows need
> login, pass `--username/--password-file` now so authenticated pages are reachable.

#### 2b. FE: register the app's test-hook attribute

If the source tags elements with something other than `data-testid` (e.g. `data-element`),
run `testsprite project update <projectId> --test-id-attributes data-element,data-testid`
once; exported locators then use the tag (check: `project get` → `testIdAttrs:`).

### 3. Get the tests — try generation first, author by hand if it isn't available

#### 3a. Preferred: generate → review → accept

TestSprite proposes the cases; proposals stage **on the server** (nothing lands in the
repo) and you accept the ones worth keeping.

**API projects need an API spec first** — with none, generation stops at
`no_processed_inputs`. Upload the spec (the file is only read). A PRD is optional and goes
**alongside** the spec, not instead of it: endpoints are read from the spec, and the PRD
shapes the feature map (`--role prd`, 0.5 credits). A PRD alone can charge the strategy
stage and then fail with no endpoints found. Frontend projects skip this, since exploring
the live app creates their inputs.

```bash
testsprite project docs upload ./openapi.yaml --project <projectId> --role api-doc
testsprite project docs upload ./prd.md --project <projectId> --role prd   # optional, with the spec
```

```bash
testsprite test plan generate --project <projectId>
```

It runs only the stages the project is missing and prints proposals with stable ids. A
fresh frontend project takes minutes (browser agents visit the app) — that's normal;
Ctrl-C only detaches, the work continues. If it says inputs are still processing, wait
and re-run.

**Review the table before accepting — that's the quality gate, and it's your job.** Check
titles and steps against what you learned in step 1; drop anything testing a flow the repo
doesn't have, duplicating another, or asserting something vague.

```bash
testsprite test plan accept --project <projectId>                       # all of them
testsprite test plan accept --project <projectId> --only prop_2 prop_5  # or a subset
```

A subset accept **discards the rest**, so name every proposal you want in that one call.
Then `testsprite test list --project <projectId>` for the ids, and go to step 5
(**skip step 4** — that's the hand-authoring path).

**If generation isn't available, fall back to 3b — don't stall.** That means an unknown
`test plan generate` command (older CLI), an account not on the V3 platform (exit 6), or
no reachable URL and no source to read. Say which happened, then author the tests
yourself; don't ask the user to upgrade or migrate first.

#### 3b. Fallback: author the tests by hand (quality over quantity)

**Frontend** — one JSON plan file per flow, in a directory (e.g. `./testsprite-plans/`).
Each file is a COMPLETE plan and must include `projectId` (from step 2), `type: "frontend"`,
`name`, and `planSteps` — `create-batch` reads the project from each file, not from a flag:

```json
{
  "projectId": "<projectId from step 2>",
  "type": "frontend",
  "name": "Checkout — guest can complete a purchase",
  "planSteps": [
    { "type": "action", "description": "Navigate to /products and open the first product" },
    { "type": "action", "description": "Click 'Add to cart', then go to /cart" },
    {
      "type": "assertion",
      "description": "The cart shows exactly 1 line item with the product's name and price"
    },
    { "type": "action", "description": "Proceed to checkout as guest and submit the test payment" },
    { "type": "assertion", "description": "A confirmation page appears showing an order number" }
  ]
}
```

**Backend** — one `.py` file per endpoint, using `requests` with concrete assertions on
status code and response body.

**Backend auth — read the injected `__AUTH_HEADERS__`, NEVER hardcode any credential.** This
covers **every** secret the API needs — Bearer/JWT tokens **and** API keys (`sk-…`,
`x-api-key`), basic-auth blobs, cookies. TestSprite prepends a managed credential block
(`__AUTH_CREDENTIAL__` / `__AUTH_TYPE__` / `__AUTH_HEADERS__`) to every backend test from the
project's Authentication settings, and `__AUTH_HEADERS__` already holds the right header(s) for
the configured type (Bearer → `{"Authorization": "Bearer …"}`; API key → `{"X-API-Key": "…"}`;
basic → `{"Authorization": "Basic …"}`). Spread it into your request headers — never paste a
literal `Bearer …` / `sk-…` / key value into the script:

```python
r = requests.get(f"{TARGET_URL}/orders", headers={**__AUTH_HEADERS__})
```

Configure the credential once on the project (ask the user for the value — never invent it or
reuse a key you happened to see): a static credential with
`testsprite project credential <projectId> --type "Bearer token"|"API key"|"basic token" --credential <value>`,
or an auto-refreshing login with `testsprite project auto-auth <projectId> …` so scheduled/repeat
runs keep working after the token expires. A hardcoded token expires within hours and a hardcoded
key can't be rotated centrally — `test create` emits a `[warn]` on an inlined credential; treat it
as a must-fix.

**Assertion rule (this is the whole game for FE):** every `assertion` step must name a
**concrete, observable** outcome — an element, text, URL, count, or status. Never write
`"verify it works"`, `"check the page loads"`, or other narrative that an AI judge can
rubber-stamp. Vague assertions are how false-PASS sneaks in.

Aim for ~8–15 tests covering the core flows. Don't pad.

### 4. Batch-create (hand-authored path only — skip if you accepted generated proposals)

Frontend (one call, up to 50 plans from the directory — `create-batch` is FE-only and has
**no `--project` flag**; the project comes from each plan file's `projectId`):

```bash
testsprite test create-batch --plan-from-dir ./testsprite-plans
```

Backend (one call per file — `create-batch` is FE-only; `--name` is required):

```bash
testsprite test create --type backend --name "<behavior being tested>" \
  --code-file ./tests/<endpoint>.py --project <projectId>
```

Capture the created `testId`s from the output.

### 5. Smoke-run a few — NOT all (protect credits)

Pick the **2–3 highest-value happy-path** tests (prefer ones you're most confident are green)
and run only those:

```bash
testsprite test run <testId> --wait
```

Do **not** run the whole suite automatically — a 20-test FE suite is ~40 credits and a free
account only has 150. Running the full suite is the user's explicit choice.

### 6. Report

Tell the user, plainly:

- "Your project now has **N** tests covering: <list the flows>."
- "I smoke-ran **M** — here's the result: <pass/fail + the dashboard link from the run output>."
- "To run the rest (≈X credits — state the cost so they choose knowingly):
  - frontend — run each remaining test by id: `testsprite test run <testId> --wait` (there is
    **no `--all` for frontend**);
  - backend — `testsprite test run --all --project <id>` (wave-ordered, runs every BE test)."

## Quality checklist (self-check before reporting done)

- [ ] FE project has a real `--url`; login configured if the app needs it.
- [ ] API project: an API spec uploaded before generating (a PRD is optional, alongside it) — or you used path 3b.
- [ ] If you generated: you **read the proposals** and dropped the ones that don't fit,
      rather than accepting the batch unseen.
- [ ] Every FE assertion names a concrete, observable outcome (no "verify it works").
- [ ] Tests cover the core flows you found in the code, not just one page.
- [ ] Smoke-ran 2–3 happy-path tests, not the whole suite.
- [ ] Reported test count, smoke result + dashboard link, and the cost to run the rest.

## Don'ts

- Don't auto-run the full suite (credit wall / surprise 402).
- Don't write narrative assertions an AI judge can't fail.
- Don't call backend endpoints directly — only the `testsprite` CLI.
- Don't create a FE project without a URL.
- Don't re-seed a project that already has tests — that's not this skill's job.
- Don't accept a generated batch unread — reviewing it is the point of the staging step.
- Don't stall when generation isn't available — say so and hand-author instead.
- Don't re-run `test plan generate` hoping for a different batch: with proposals already
  staged it starts nothing, and regenerating is a Portal action today.

## Hand off to verify

This skill's job ends once the project has a seeded suite and a first green run. From here on,
the **`testsprite-verify`** skill takes over: after the user changes code, it runs the tests
covering that change before they report the work done. Onboard once; verify continuously.
